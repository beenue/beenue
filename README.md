### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm a software engineer student at TripleTen

I'm currently learning javascript as part of my fullstack engineering bootcamp.
I'm hoping to complete this bootcamp within the next 5-6 months and then pursue my master's degree in computer science.
Originally I was a pilot and am now shifting careers over to something that has always interested me.
